# Pneumonia Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is built using TensorFlow and utilizes the ResNet50V2 architecture.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes: normal and pneumonia. The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on the ResNet50V2 convolutional neural network, pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. The final layer of the ResNet50V2 backbone is replaced with a Global Average Pooling layer followed by a Dense layer with sigmoid activation, making it suitable for binary classification.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, with a precision of X% and recall of X%.
